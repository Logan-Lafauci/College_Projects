# CSC4101_P1

Hayley Roberts and Logan Lafauci

This is a pretty printer project designed for Scheme 48 for our CSC 4101 programming languages class.

We worked first to complete the Scanner.py then Parser.py. Next we completed all of the printing methods inside of the Special class.
We fixed Parser.py as we came across errors designing the pretty printer. 
We have tested all of the different Token types and all of the Node types extensively to ensure that every piece works. 
The end parentheses and values all get printed on the same line unless specified to print on the next line.
However, the cursor ends up on the same line when the program is finished running. 

Have fun.
